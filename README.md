# Key Features
 - Client side parsing & Processing - Data never leaves your browser
 - Utilizes RegEx magic :crystal_ball: to parse transactions to a standard format
 - ~~Support for all Indian bank's credit card statements~~ ( Only works with HDFC One's for now :eyes:)

## Inspiration
I wanted to track my expenses and tried to export my HDFC Credit Card statement, but they only offer exporting to PDF which isn't helpful for importing it to other places. I wanted a pet project, and this seemed like a perfect excuse to build one :wink:
